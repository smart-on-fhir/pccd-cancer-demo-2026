# Use-Case Background

Pediatric low-grade glioma (pLGG) is the most common childhood central nervous system (CNS) tumor, representing approximately 30% of pediatric brain tumors. Although potentially curable in certain locations by complete surgical resection, tumors located in critical areas of the brain not amenable to complete resection may induce functional deficits and/or have an aggressive biology. Given the chronic nature of pLGG, children often require several lines of treatment in their first two decades of life. Treatment goals include regression or stabilization (at a minimum) of disease and neurologic deficits; avoidance of potential acute and long-term toxicities (especially those limiting cognitive functions); and the ability to participate in age-appropriate activities. Frontline systemic therapy currently consists of chemotherapy, which can achieve overall response rates (ORRs) of around 30% and can provide durable responses in some children. However, many patients will progress during or after therapy with these agents. There is currently no global uniform consensus on first-line or second-line/further-line standard of care in this setting for most patients.

# pLGG Diagnosis 

Low Grade Glioma: Defined by the WHO 2021 criteria -- often not fully captured by clinical codes but may be in `pathology report`.

1. **Pediatric-type Diffuse Low-Grade Gliomas**

* Diffuse astrocytoma, MYB- or MYBL1-altered Angiocentric glioma.

* Polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumor of the young (PLNTY): known for its oligodendroglioma-like appearance, CD34 expression, and frequent BRAF V600E or FGFR2/3 alterations.
* Diffuse low-grade glioma, MAPK pathway-altered: A newly recognized entity encompassing gliomas with varying morphology but shared MAPK mutations (e.g., FGFR1 or BRAF V600E). A specific grade is not yet assigned. 

2. **Circumscribed Astrocytic Tumors**

* Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA): The most common pediatric brain tumor (Grade 1), typically driven by KIAA1549::BRAF fusions.
* Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA): Often Grade 2 or 3, frequently harboring BRAF V600E mutations and CDKN2A/B deletions.
* Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA): Associated with tuberous sclerosis and TSC1/TSC2 mutations.

3. **Glioneuronal & Neuronal Tumors**

* Ganglioglioma

* Desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma (DIG) / Desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma (DIA)

* Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET)

* Diffuse glioneuronal tumor with oligodendroglioma-like features and nuclear clusters (DGONC) - Provisional entity

* Papillary glioneuronal tumor (PGNT)

* Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor (RFGT)

* Myxoid glioneuronal tumor (MGT) - New entity

* Diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor (DLGNT)

* Gangliocytoma

* Multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumor (MVNT) - New entity

* Dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma (Lhermitte-Duclos disease)

* Central neurocytoma

* Extraventricular neurocytoma

* Cerebellar liponeurocytoma
